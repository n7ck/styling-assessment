---------------------

# Before you begin

1. Clone this repo
2. On the command line, navigate to this directory.
3. Run `npm i` to get necessary dependencies for build tools


## Frontend Development

This page leverages Symfony's Webpack Encore library for building and bundling assets ([more on Encore here](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html#webpack-encore))

For Sass, use the `scss/style.scss` as your entrypoint (i.e. `@import "./hero";`).

### Building Sass and Javascript

1. On the command line, navigate to this directory.
2. Run `npm run watch`
3. A watcher will initialize and build changes as they occur.  Note: you will need to refresh your browser to see these changes; no hot reload included.
